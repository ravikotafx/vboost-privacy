# Privacy Policy for vboost - Premium Tab Volume Booster

Last updated: February 4, 2026

vboost respects your privacy. This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage metrics.

### Data Collection
vboost does NOT collect any personally identifiable information, browsing history, or user activity. All state management (such as volume levels and EQ presets) is stored locally within your browser's temporary session storage (chrome.storage.session) and is cleared when your session ends.

### Audio Processing
All audio processing is performed locally on your device using the Web Audio API and Chrome's tabCapture API. Audio data is processed in real-time and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted outside your device.

### Permissions
vboost requests only the permissions required for its core functionality:
- tabCapture & offscreen: To route and process audio streams within the browser.
- activeTab: To enable the booster only when you explicitly invoke the extension on a specific page.
- storage: To maintain your volume and EQ preferences across your browser session.

These permissions are used strictly for technical orchestration and are never used to monitor or collect user information.

### Third Parties
vboost does not share data with any third parties. We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, advertising SDKs, or any other external services.

### Changes
If this privacy policy is updated, the newest version will be posted here.

### Contact
If you have questions about this privacy policy, you may contact the developer through the support section of the Chrome Web Store listing.
